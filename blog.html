    <p> There must be an easier way to do this. I hope I am not making any mistakes.
      Can I use a new line here? One way to find out.
      I always wanted to make a blog because I wanted to Express Myself, like Easy E said. I hope I can continue this
      "venture" that I have set upon and improve this site.
      As Professor John Heng said, do a gradual deprecation of doing work. If I cannot make a good website, just make a
      bare bones versions and leave the development for tomorrow.
      This feels great. I want to develop this. (We will see about that :P)
      Okay I got to go and get some pizza. Got to socialize a bit, after all life is short.
      Also, need to do final year project work instead of goofing around with websites.
      Enough for now I guess.
      lol

    <p>
      The rate at which things are going is too slow. Need to start building things and improve my skills on technology.
      Okay, let's see...
      How to make a blog? What will my blog have? I believe it needs a picture of me. Let me add that feature using
      cascade.

      Okay, so I am now learning how to add pictures to my html file. Lets see...
      <br>
      Why isnt the thing updating? <br>
      It seems it takes a while to update, so no worries. I will have to open in a local browser to see the updates. That
      is fair.<br>
      Added CSS file too, I think I am getting the hang of it with the immense help of Github Copilot. It makes it so easy!
      <br> There must be a way to input what I want to add and then add to the blog. Or, I can make a subwebpage for the blogs. Hmm... I feel sleepy now. (4:30 am lol)
    </p>

      Having autopilot suggest stuff is so weird. <br>
      Okay, I believe in trying three times to push myself in a day... because I believe that all I need is a push. <br> 
      And then, I can do the required difficult work. Making a portfolio website aligns with my future goals, and a development log will help me keep my sanity. 
      <br>
      I want to build a cute website, something that is consistent with my style. I need to decide the structure of the website.
      I also need to know what to put on the website... and I just believe that I need to push myself to start. <br>
      It does not help that suddenly I am feeling very sleepy. Hmm... <br> 
      But going ahead with the initial momentum that I pushed myself with, I need to have a personal webiste and a portfolio. 
      About myself, I can put on some thoughts about myself, like how some other people I know put about themselves. Now that I am quite lonely, I guess some 
      amount of expressing myself is needed. The innate need to be witnessed is something that I still have not completely arranged for. <br> 
      <figure style="text-align: center;">

        <figcaption>WITNESS MEEEE! - from Mad Max Fury Road. And Mad Max is sitting cheekily behind there :)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      A personal website, and a portfolio website. Personal website has blogs, youtube channel? and instagram channel? Like what all are those for even?
      Lol, should I put my phone number in public too? Hahahaha. By they way, this is my credit card number: 4325523565737567 and the pin is 986474.
      <br>
      I want to stream myself cycling around SG. Or atleast have a video. I want to stream playing chess. And maybe a few video games in there. 
      My life should not be all about work. I can talk about some of the greater arts that I have come across in "cool stuff" section where I put my reviews.

        This is me chilling. I figured out how to add a blog page I guess. Just like a cute hyper link and stuff. Let me quickly add a link back.
