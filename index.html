<p> There must be an easier way to do this. I hope I am not making any mistakes.
Can I use a new line here? One way to find out. 
I always wanted to make a blog because I wanted to Express Myself, like Easy E said. I hope I can continue this "venture" that I have set upon and improve this site.
As Professor John Heng said, do a gradual deprecation of doing work. If I cannot make a good website, just make a bare bones versions and leave the development for tomorrow. 
This feels great. I want to develop this. (We will see about that :P)
Okay I got to go and get some pizza. Got to socialize a bit, after all life is short. 
Also, need to do final year project work instead of goofing around with websites.
Enough for now I guess.
