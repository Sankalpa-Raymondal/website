<p> There must be an easier way to do this. I hope I am not making any mistakes.
Can I use a new line here? One way to find out. 
I always wanted to make a blog because I wanted to Express Myself, like Easy E said. I hope I can continue this "venture" that I have set upon and improve this site.
As Professor John Heng said, do a gradual deprecation of doing work. If I cannot make a good website, just make a bare bones versions and leave the development for tomorrow. 
This feels great. I want to develop this. (We will see about that :P)
Okay I got to go and get some pizza. Got to socialize a bit, after all life is short. 
Also, need to do final year project work instead of goofing around with websites.
Enough for now I guess.

The rate at which things are going is too slow. Need to start building things and improve my skills on technology. Okay, let's see...
How to make a blog? What will my blog have? I believe it needs a picture of me. Let me add that feature using cascade. 
</p>

<div class="content">
  <!-- Example of how to add images -->
  <h2>My Pictures</h2>
  
  <!-- Example 1: Basic image -->
  <img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description of your image">
  
  <!-- Example 2: Image with specific size -->
  <img src="images/another-image.jpg" alt="Another image description" width="300" height="200">
  
  <!-- Note: Replace 'your-image.jpg' and 'another-image.jpg' with your actual image filenames -->
  <p>To add your pictures:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Save your pictures in the 'images' folder</li>
    <li>Use the img tag as shown above</li>
    <li>Always include an 'alt' attribute for accessibility</li>
    <li>Optionally set width and height</li>
  </ol>
</div>

</body>
</html>
