  <p> There must be an easier way to do this. I hope I am not making any mistakes.
    Can I use a new line here? One way to find out.
    I always wanted to make a blog because I wanted to Express Myself, like Easy E said. I hope I can continue this
    "venture" that I have set upon and improve this site.
    As Professor John Heng said, do a gradual deprecation of doing work. If I cannot make a good website, just make a
    bare bones versions and leave the development for tomorrow.
    This feels great. I want to develop this. (We will see about that :P)
    Okay I got to go and get some pizza. Got to socialize a bit, after all life is short.
    Also, need to do final year project work instead of goofing around with websites.
    Enough for now I guess.
    lol

    The rate at which things are going is too slow. Need to start building things and improve my skills on technology.
    Okay, let's see...
    How to make a blog? What will my blog have? I believe it needs a picture of me. Let me add that feature using
    cascade.
  </p>

  <div class="content">
    <!-- Example of how to add images -->
    <h2>My Pictures</h2>

    <!-- Example 1: Basic image -->
    <img src="images/under_construction.jpg"
      alt="under construction image, explaining that this website is pretty shoddy">

  </div>

    Okay, so I am now learning how to add pictures to my html file. Lets see...
    <br>
    Why isnt the thing updating? <br>
    It seems it takes a while to update, so no worries. I will have to open in a local browser to see the updates. That
    is fair.<br>
    Added CSS file too, I think I am getting the hang of it with the immense help of Github Copilot. It makes it so easy!
    <br> There must be a way to input what I want to add and then add to the blog. Or, I can make a subwebpage for the blogs. Hmm... I feel sleepy now. (4:30 am lol)
